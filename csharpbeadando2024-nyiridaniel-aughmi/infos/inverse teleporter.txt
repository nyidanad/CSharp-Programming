INVERSE TELEPORTER
------------------------------------------------
The inverse teleporter is a modified teleporter 
which will teleport you to a random position 
outside the ship. All your items will be dropped 
at the teleporter before transport. The inverse 
teleporter can be used by everyone at once and 
has a 3.5 minute cooldown.

DISCLAIMER: The inverse teleporter can only 
transport you in, not out, and you may become 
trapped. The Company is not responsible for 
injury or replacement of heads and limbs induced 
by quantum entanglement and bad luck.
